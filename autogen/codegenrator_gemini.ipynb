            "    *   **Data Fetcher Agent:** Downloads historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.\n",

            "5.  **Implement Agent Logic:**\n",
            "    *   **Data Fetcher:** Use `yfinance` to download data for a given stock ticker.\n",
            "    *   **Fundamental Analysis:** Use Gemini to analyze downloaded fundamental data (e.g., P/E ratio, EPS, revenue growth, debt-to-equity) and provide a qualitative assessment.\n",
            "    *   **Technical Analysis:** Utilize a suitable Python library (like `pandas_ta`) for calculating technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, etc.). Then, use Gemini to interpret these indicators and suggest whether to invest.\n",
            "    *   **Investment Strategy:** Combine insights from both analyses. If both agree on investability, use Gemini to suggest entry and exit points based on the technical indicators and overall market sentiment.\n",
